# qemu-osdev
Custom QEMU for operating systems development


This is a custom, patched QEMU which supports verbose error messages, detailed monitor support for processor structures,
and other useful goodies to make operating system development (for coursework or just as a hobby) a bit easier.

Development is still underway and the README will be updated as new features are developed and merged. Stay tuned!
